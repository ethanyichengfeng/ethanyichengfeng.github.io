<!-- Hi! I am Yicheng Feng, you can call me Ethan. I currently a two-half-year master student at Tianjin University majoring in Software Engineering.
I work on cloud/edge computing, with focus on resource management/scheduling, container optimization, and edge intelligence. I have a very strong interest in cloud-native technology.
最近，我已经开始了关于video system方向的研究，这将会是一个全新的挑战！

现阶段，我正在香港中文大学进行Research Assistant的工作，受Prof. [Henry Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io/)指导.
我的硕士导师是Prof. [Xiaofei Wang](http://www.drxiaofei.wang/), 如果顺利，我会于明年1月毕业:).在此期间，我作为实习生参与了中国边缘云公司[PPIO](https://www.ppio.cn/)的IaaS团队，并且进行了一系列产学合作项目，这令人兴奋！

Prior to TJU, I received my Bachelor's degree from Jiangnan University in 2021. 这是热烈而丰富的4年，我代表学校参与了省运会、担任过主持、模特、配音，和我的伙伴们开发了无数款Unity游戏，还担任了院社联主席与班长。我爱JNU。

我受 Prof. [Xiaofei Wang](http://www.drxiaofei.wang/)指导，

I am advised by Prof. [Elfar Adalsteinsson](https://www.rle.mit.edu/people/directory/elfar-adalsteinsson/) and collaborate closely with Prof. [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) and Prof. [P. Ellen Grant](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W4dqZ7EAAAAJ).

I also did summer internships at Google and Meta, working on automated Ads bidding and large-scale video recommendation systems respectively.

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2018. I also spent a summer as a research assistant at Stanford, where I was advised by Prof. [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/) and Prof. [Greg Zaharchuk](https://profiles.stanford.edu/greg-zaharchuk). -->

Hello there! I'm Yicheng Feng, you can just call me Ethan. I am currently a two-and-a-half-year master's student at Tianjin University, China, specializing in Software Engineering. My focus is on cloud and edge computing, particularly resource management, scheduling, container optimization, and edge intelligence. I have a strong passion for cloud-native technology.

At present, I am working as a Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the guidance of Prof. [Henry Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io/). I've embarked on research in the realm of video systems, which presents an entirely new and exciting challenge!

My master's advisor is Prof. [Xiaofei Wang](http://www.drxiaofei.wang/), and if all goes well, I will be graduating in January next year :). During this journey, I had the privilege of interning with the IaaS team at [PPIO](https://www.ppio.cn/) Edge Clouds Co., Ltd., China. This experience led to a series of fruitful industry-academic collaborative projects – truly exhilarating!

Before my time at TJU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Jiangnan University, China, in 2021. Those were four vibrant and eventful years. I represented the school in provincial sports games, took on roles as a host, model, and voice actor. Together with my partners, I developed numerous Unity games and served as the President of the School-Student Union and class monitor. I have a deep affection for JNU.
